As such, our project brief was designed to push us into this emerging
                            field and consider users might control these vehicles, how we might design the interfaces between users and AI.<br><br>The idea was to conceptualise and prove the need for an autonomous product, then design and develop the
                            user interface for it. Since autonomous vehicles is still a very broad field, we split into teams and chose a field to focus our research. We chose urban agriculture; that is any farming or gardening in inner city environments.
                            We felt that agriculture in itself was an easy target for automation and urban agriculture was both more accessible than the more commonly considered rural agriculture and there would be more room for innovation as it's a more
                            overlooked space.</p><div class="team-grid">

Then we put our ideas under
                            scrutiny, validating them with user research until we cut down the ideas that didn’t appear to effectively solve real problems (reduction), once we settled on an idea we iterated and reduced it further, distilling it to the
                            final prototype.<br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/background%20research.jpg" style="background-size: auto;background-position: center;background-repeat: no-repeat;margin-top: 0px;"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio%20progress%20bar%202.png"><div class="features-boxed">

            <p class="text-center">Since our team consisted of four university students who had no gardens of their own, our research was cut out for us. To tackle the area we split the sector up into 4 main stakeholders that we thought would offer the most insight for our
                project; Council, Developers, Architects/Developers and Decentralised farmers. I chose to research the council&#39;s role because it seemed they had the most direct and immediate impact on day-to-day urban agriculture<br /></p>

                        Tempe and took notes on the plants, layout, participants and organisers</p>

                                sector; people have plants and crops in their garden to get food, look pretty and maybe even make money. After investigating further I found there were benefits to urban agriculture, the scope and breadth of which I hadn’t
                                imagined; urban agriculture is a multi-million dollar industry that councils and governments are severely undervaluing, community gardens are a pillar of society, gardens provide people with invaluable fulfillment, and
                                while people love to garden life has an awful habit of getting in the way.<br><br>During the foundational research stage, I found reviewing documents from The Yarra Council in Melbourne concerning their urban agriculture
                                strategy. The key takeaway from the report was that community gardens are viewed as a ‘holistic solution to an array of social issues in the community’. Perhaps it was just that urban agriculture isn’t typically reported
                                on and backyard success is appealing subject matter, but during my online research I found a lot of reports that urban agriculture was a profitable niche good and that produce from backyard farms is of a higher quality
                                than mass market alternatives thus deserving of a higher premium.<br><br>The academic research elaborated further on the financial viability of urban agriculture and also made me realise the huge role government and councils
                                play in fostering urban farms and have been playing for decades, dating back to the ‘Grow your own’ campaign launched by Commonwealth Department of Commerce and Agriculture back in 1943. More startlingly a longitudinal
                                study by Dr James, S and Professor O’Neil on behalf of the NSW Department of Planning looked at all the agriculture projects in Sydney over 20 years and consistently found, year after year, the scale and value of Sydney’s
                                agriculture was severely undervalued by the ABS, with underestimations by 10 - 100 million.<br>Following these rounds of formal research I relaxed things a bit and got coffee with a City of Sydney employee in the cultural
                                strategy department. He hammered home the social benefits of community gardens, particularly for those who are elderly or disadvantaged. He was also critical of industry developments concerning urban agriculture, skeptical
                                of their motivations, explaining that Central Towers (a development known for its plants that hang along the side and community garden, a development that JX was also investigating for his sector) had actually implemented
                                their iconic vertical garden to cover up a poorly designed exterior that doesn’t meet ‘best practice’ and without which would be unacceptable.<br><br>My contextual observations at the City of Sydney community garden workshop
                                in Tempe was that there clearly wasn’t any issue with scale or funding, which went against my expectations. However I did notice that everything was done manually, carrying, planting and watering, as such there could definitely
                                be an opportunity there for automation.<br>Similarly the contextual interviews wasn’t quite what I expected. Different demographics had different motivations for being into urban agriculture; the older participants were
                                there more for the social element whilst the younger participants were there to learn and engage with farming from a sustainability standpoint. <br><br>Below I've generated three personas that encapsulate user needs drawn
                                from these findings.<br><br><br></p>

In the carousel below you can see the two that I came up with:<br><br>The
                first sketch is a concept is called Garden Guardian and is somewhat based on the aged care robots that are starting to be implemented in Japan. The idea was mainly taken from problem statements found in my field of research, exploring
                the holistic benefits of gardening, particularly for those who are elderly, it gives them a purpose to get out of bed and keeps their body moving. The idea behind the robot was to assist elderly people with their gardening without taking
                the task away from them entirely, to help when needed and be passive whenever possible. Additionally, the robot keeps an eye on the older individual and ensures that if any harm comes to them, to notify the relevant authorities immediately.
                Lastly the Garden Guardian was conceptualised to provide companionship when gardening, of course nothing can replace the companionship of a real person but as was found in Japan, unfortunately there are many cases in which it’s a robot
                or nothing and a robot is far better than nothing. However this concept was ultimately abandoned as although we’re not building the physical device we found the technology to achieve our desired outcome is far from developed at the cutting
                edge, let alone accessible for this sort of project. Perhaps by the time we’re retired companionship robots will be commonplace but at this stage the idea was just too Sci-Fi for the scope of our project.<br><br>The second is WaterBug
                (the concept we ended up running with) an autonomous consumer drone, similar to the iconic ‘iRobot’ vacuum cleaner drone, only this drone resembles more closely an R/C toy combined with a ‘Super Soaker’. This little all terrain vehicle
                is designed to navigate your backyard autonomously and water each plant according to its specific needs before refilling and recharging at its docking station. The main problem it was trying to solve was based from prolific user struggle
                with garden maintenance; many people loved having a garden and even growing vegetables but they often abandoned their efforts due to time restraints from the rigorous upkeep demands of each plant. Below you can see this sketched out in
                a storyboard depicting an office worker with who has planted a lovely garden, only to have it dry out because he doesn’t have the time to maintain it.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/waterbug%20storyboard.png">

WaterBug was selected along with Jason's Roaming Garden and LifeCycle as well
                as Abhinav's Air Agriculture. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

We each developed hand drawn sketches that were then fed into prototyping tools; POP/Marvel, Invision and framer. We used these very rough sketches to
                    test out the user flow of our interfaces with test subjects, using ‘Think aloud’, observations and post test interviews to ascertain our results. Below you will see two carousels, one displaying the early sketches I developed for WaterBug’s
                    onboarding and installation screens, early sketches for system functionality by JX and the next shows us testing with users in the field. The test subjects we had chosen were young attendees of the Jubilee Park Community garden space
                    that were aged 19 - 31.<br><br></p>

However it was in this initial round of testing where we first encountered the dichotomy between different groups of our potential users. Since this product
                    is supposed to be a mass-market consumer electronics device we had to balance the needs of the more technologically savvy ‘super-user’ with the needs of the less adventurous common user. This meant numerous iterations of calibration,
                    a ‘two steps forward, one step back’ approach, experimenting with more technical or accessible designs. I’ll be elaborating further on this in the wireframe stage.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/wireframe%20testing.jpg" style="background-size: auto;background-position: center;background-repeat: no-repeat;margin-top: 0;padding-top: 0px;">

                        meeting both parties specific needs. &nbsp;As previously mentioned, after our user research we decided that a mass market, consumer electronics device would be the best user group for our product. We thought it would be easy to
                        design a one-size-fits-all interface. However across our various rounds of iterations and testing we battled with meeting the expectations of our users. We kept finding the designs were often only good at accomodating to one specific
                        user group; either a technical subset of users who wish to glean the maximum functionality of our product, or the passive user who wants to use the autonomous service to find a solution wherein they can switch their brains off.
                        To resolve this dichotomy we developed &nbsp;a ‘soft induction’ approach that familarises users quickly and easily to the setup and functionality of our device and interface then we allow users a choice to either let the drone
                        function autonomously at default settings or to let power users who proved to be more inquisitive anyway, to navigate through the UI to find the additional functionality. <br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/finalmokcups.jpg"

I incorporated a dark theme so that it is less battery dependent on AMOLED screens. &nbsp;I opted for a
                        futuristic UI to complement the futuristic nature of an autonomous gardening drone.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
